"""
Transformers for autoregressive normalizing flows in PyTorch.

All the layers defined in this module are invertible and implement an
``inverse()`` method (not to be comfused with the ``Tensor``'s ``backward()``
method which backpropagate the gradients).

The forward propagation of the modules here return both the transformation
of the input plus the log determinant of the Jacobian.
